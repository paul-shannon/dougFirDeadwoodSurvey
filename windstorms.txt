My students and I have looked into this issue, as have other
weather/climate scientists.  As I shall discuss, this is not a simple
issue and uncertainties abound, but the bottom line is that there is
little evidence for area-wide increases in extreme weather due to
human-induced global warming during the past several decades over our
region.  That is not to say there won't be any in the future, but the
impacts are anything but clear.
